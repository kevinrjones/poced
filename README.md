# Poced

Poced is a direct copy of [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) in terms of UI. 

It is a learning tool for C# technologies such as MVC (5.0 initially) and EF(6.x). The CSS is a shameless rip-off of GetPocket but the underlying functionality is written from scratch.

It is **not** complete by any stretch of the imagination.
